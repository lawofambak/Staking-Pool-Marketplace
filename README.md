# Staking Pool Marketplace

## Brief Overview
For the Encode Solidity Bootcamp, my team and I created a staking pool platform that allows users to deploy their own staking pools to manage or stake in other pools deployed by others on the platform. You can view a quick presentation that explains the project with this link below.

## Notes/Comments
This project is not complete as our team was given limited time to execute our idea. The code presented in this repo shows only the worked on parts of the application by our team. Our full frontend repo is private. However, our backend repo is [here](https://github.com/icculp/staking_pool_backend) and our smart contract repo is [here](https://github.com/lawofambak/Staking-Pool-Contract).
